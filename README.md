# Kalman_display

This repository contains some of the code involved in a group project (2020.09~2020.12)
The objective was initially to address motion sickness for smartphone users using filters to predict the phone's displacement and cancel it out.
Eventually, we went with offline video stabilization, using pre-recorded video as our input due to our lacking hardware and delay from perfoming calculations.
